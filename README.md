# Covid Dashboard project 
Welcome to the smart covid dashboard project. To get started, we have to do a few things. 
## Configuration
The project pulls data from a config.json that the user can edit based on their preference. 
First, input all the data you would like to be displayed, and rename the configExample.json to config.json.

You will need an API key, and you can obtain this from the Newsapi.org website.
